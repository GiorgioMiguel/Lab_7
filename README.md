THERE SEEMS TO BE A DIFFERENCE IN OPINION WHEN TWO ELEMENTS ARE SWAPPED. ACCORDING TO LEVENT, (TA @ UCF), WHEN TWO ELEMENTS ARE SWAPPED THEY BOTH INCREMENT THEIR RESPECTIVE SWAP VALUES.
ACCORDING TO BINAY, WHEN TWO ELEMENTS ARE SWAPPED, ONLY THE ELEMENT THAT CAUSED THE SWAP INCREMENTS IT'S RESPECTIVE SWAP VALUE.
THE LAB DIRECTIONS STATE THAT THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SWAPS SHOULD NOT EQUAL THE SUM OF EACH INDIVIDUAL'S SWAP VALUE. THEREFORE IN THIS PROGRAM I WILL USE LEVENT'S METHOD INSTEAD OF BINAY.
